Code for the paper "Automated Video Labelling: Identifying Faces by Corroborative Evidence"

1) get the code for tracking and recognising faces 

2) clean it up 

3) remove all of the excess code 

4) get it working a little better

5) get the code to go from a directory of messy person images to a "clean" dictionary of face vectors
